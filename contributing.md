# Contributing / Making issues
If you experience problems with a specific web(app)

*(visible by running via Xcode or by running with parameter -debug true)*

Please use the `Debug` -> `Report an issue on this page` button, so we know the full url.

![Debug - Report an issue on this page](http://m83.imgup.net/ReportIssuf311.png)

When pressed the report your **default** webbrowser will open and redirect you to the github issues page, with some pre-filled fields, then you can enter what exactly the problem is.
